# Parasite-2
Detective game developed for two game jams.
I led its development and I took care of everything from the visuals to the scripting. I received help with the story.
The house model is a free asset and I took inspiration from tuotials in Youtube.
I learned a lot about a basic pipeline in game development, deadlines and to stick with the basic features.
I believe this project shows my diversity in skills and how much I learned to make the whole game work.
